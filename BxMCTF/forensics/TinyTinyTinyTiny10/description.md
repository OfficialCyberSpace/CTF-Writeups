Windows 10 takes up so much space and resources that I managed to strip it down to a mere 12.2MB. All I really needed to build it anyways was cmd and calc, and out of the final size, all of it is just the GPT table and other random garbage that I don't really understand.

Next year, I'm going to try and completely eliminate the GPT table too!
