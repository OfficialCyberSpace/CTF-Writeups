Ryzon, who just finished his ICS5U class, forgets that he also needs to finish his final MCV5U assignment, which is due on the same day!

Unfortunately, all of Ryzon's brain cells are destroyed due to how scuffed ICS5U is, and he begs you, his friend, to help him finish this assignment for him.

SPECIAL NOTE, PLEASE READ

The flag format for this problem is different from the rest, it is: ctf{[!-z]{6,128}} (the part inside the bracket can be any string of 6-128 printable ASCII characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols).
